# Programmer's feedback

- I really like the color scheme and theme of the design.
- Instead of having to refresh to play again and being sent to the start screen, it would flow better if it just went to the game again.
- Thereâ€™s not really much time to process hitting an obstacle. 
- Maybe add a pause before jumping to the game over screen.
- I like how smooth it jumps to the next level/new set of obstacles. 
- Maybe also have a visual representation to show how many the player gets through.



# A non - programmers feedback

- More than one player
- Being able to pause and resume the game
- Keep track of high score
- Boosts/Upgrades
- Word of the day to collect
