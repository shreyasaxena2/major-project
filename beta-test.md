# Programmer's feedback

- I really like the color scheme and theme of the design.
- Instead of having to refresh to play again and being sent to the start screen, it would flow better if it just went to the game again.
- Thereâ€™s not really much time to process hitting an obstacle. 
- Maybe add a pause before jumping to the game over screen.
- I like how smooth it jumps to the next level/new set of obstacles. 
- Maybe also have a visual representation to show how many the player gets through.



# A non - programmers feedback

- I liked the concept a lot overall, it was clear and simple, while still being engaging and fun
- The little icon that moved was a super cute design!
- The directions were straightforward, and I was able to execute all the moves easily; I found that it moved very smoothly
- I liked that there were different levels as opposed to staying on the same screen constantly, it made the game more fun
- One piece of feedback would be to have an indication that the game is about to end if possible, as it was a little abrupt
