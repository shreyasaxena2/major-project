# What advice would you give to yourself if you were to start a project like this again?
- If I was to do a project like this again, I would first manage my time better. 
- This includes not working late at night and using my class time a little bit better so I would not have to work so hard over the break.
- If something is not working, I would change focus and work on a different part of the project.

# Did you complete everything in your “needs to have” list?
- Yes, i was able to finish everything I wanted.
- I am quite satisfied.

# What was the hardest part of the project?
- Getting the time left working proved to be quite difficult.
- The time was off by a second, so I had to be careful to see when the time started counting.
- I had a very hard time figuring out how to keep the high score working correctly.
- I am still not sure if it is fully working.

# Were there any problems you could not solve?
- High score might not be working fully.
- I have one hypothesis on what might break that part of the code.
- Since when you are done playing, you press E or e to remove the high score variable from memory. So if someone who had played with the flawed version of the game before might have the score saved. this might mess with the first time a player plays the game.
